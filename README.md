### instructions include
- Do not worry about making your project look nice on mobile. Responsive design isnâ€™t covered until later in the curriculum.
- Validating that the password fields match each other requires JavaScript. Using JavaScript to validate forms is covered in a future lesson. For now, just validate each field separately.

## todo
- [ ] handling of different aspect ratios (as there's a major issue of overflow)
- [ ] implement a better font for text in the right-column
